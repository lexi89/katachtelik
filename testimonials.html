					developed a website for Yvette Puliga and Kat produced the copy. I have to say I am more than
					impressed, not only with the content produced but the whole process, which was <strong>smooth, quick
						and so organised</strong>. She beats deadlines and delivers the copy for feedback in a simple
					and efficient way for both the client and myself to review and provide feedback which I could then
					quickly implement – <strong>this was like web design on steroids!</strong> On top of that it was
					great to also have her input and <strong>feedback on layouts and design </strong> so we could
					showcase the content and client in the best light ... I cannot wait to work with Kat again. She an
					amazing person and would not hesitate to recommend her. Thank you Kat, I am so glad I met you."
